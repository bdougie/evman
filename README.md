# EvMan

EvMan (Event Manager) is an open-source tool for your team to manage events.
Events are managed from the perspective of people who travel for them (e.g.
developer advocated, etc.) and is not targeted (at this time) to people who
organize events. There is a ton of tools for managing events, however we did
not find any, that would be tweaked for people who attend.

In case you do not want to run your own instance, we are also providing EvMan
as a [service](https://www.evman.io).

EvMan can be run on OpenShift, any other hosting platform or just simple VPS.
